# tornado-electron-test

### install and run

Node.js LTS (14.17.0) and python3 should be installed.

Use `npm install` to install dependencies (tornado will be installed automatically), then run server and app simultaneously via `npm start`.
On Windows 10 you can use `install_and_run.bat` script.

Afterwards the app will open and display data from the running server. 
You can check for availability of the data on the server here: 
`http://localhost:8888/data/data.json`
